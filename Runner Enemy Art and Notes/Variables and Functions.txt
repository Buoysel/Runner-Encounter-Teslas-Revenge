Start()

No need for Update()? (Maybe comment it just in case)

ListSentences()
    Add sentence to sentenceList<string>


ListAnswers()
    answerList is a new List (I'm hoping that will clear it each time)
    Switch (randomNum)
        case 0:
            Add "and" to answerList;
            Add "," to answerList;
            break;

        case 1:
            Add ";" to answerList;
            Add "or" to answerList;
            break;

        case 2:
            Add "so" to answerList;
            break;

    And so on to match the number of Sentences.
    Sentences and their corresponding answers should have the
    same index value.

SetHP()
    Add player HP gameObjects to playerHPList<gameObject>
    Add enemy HP gameObjects to enemyHPList<gameObject>

ListButtons()
    Add all items with the tag "wordButton" to buttonList<gameObject>

DisplaySentence()
    randNum is a random number between 0 and the length of the sentenceList.

    if randNum is not in usedSentence:
        text gameObject text is set to sentencList[randNum]
        randNum is added to usedSentences
        ListAnswers()
    else
        Recur and DisplaySentence()

    underscoreLoc is equal to the index where the "___" is found in the current
    sentence.

EvaluateAnswer()
    This is called by the buttons' script.
    If the current answer is in AnswerList
        CorrectAnswer()
    else
        WrongAnswer()

CorrectAnswer()
    Delete enemyHPList[0]
    Color enemyHPList[0] red? (Never did that...)
    For every button in buttonList
        buttonList.Button.Interactable = true
        buttonList Image Color Alpha is 100% (255)

    If enemyHPList is empty
        UI text is "Victory!"
        StartCoroutine(Delay())
        Quit Editor game
        //Some way to exit game in TR
    else
        cut "___" from the sentence
        replace with the button's value at underscoreLoc
        StartCoroutine(Delay())
        DisplaySentence()

WrongAnswer()
    Delete playerHPList[0]
    Color playerHPList[0] red
    this.Button.Interactable = false
    this button's Image Color Alpha is 50%(127)

    if playerHPList is empty
        UI text is "You've been defeated!"
        StartCoroutine(Delay)
        Quit Editor Game
        //Some way to exit game in TR
    else
        DisplaySentence()

Delay()
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(5)
