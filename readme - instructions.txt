In this game, the player is presented with a run-on sentence that they will have
to fix, either by inserting a comma, period, or an "And".

1. Use either the arrow keys or 'A' and 'D' to move through the sentence. A
   Red '_' will appear at every space between characters.

2. Click the period, comma, or 'and' buttons to insert the corresponding symbol
   at that space.

3. If the sentence is fixed, click 'Submit' and the game will check to see if
   the run-on has been fixed correctly.
      * If the player is correct, the Runner will show a damage animation. The
      Runner will lose HP will the player gains HP.
      * If the player is incorrect, the Runner will damage the player, and the
      player will lose HP.

4. The 'Erase' button will remove a period, comma, or 'And' behind it.

5. The 'Reset' button will restore the Run-on to its previous state.


If the player is on their last health, a hint will appear under the Runner.
